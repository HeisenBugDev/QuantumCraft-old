Yet another mod that ends with \"Craft\"**_\r\n\r\n### My story\r\nIt all started a few months ago. I decided that I'd like to work on somthing big. A bigger mod than those I made before. I definitely knew that I wanted a tech mod, even though there is a lot of tech mods already. I just needed to think of what it'd be about and the name. So i figured out, that i would have multiple types of energy. the names were:\r\n* Positronium\r\n* Radium\r\n* Gammatronium\r\n* Neutrinium\r\n\r\nAll those are kinda particle / radiation related, so I thought the name Quantum is OK. then i just appended craft and i got a minecraft mod name. I started to work on it, made some blocks, items and renderers. After that, I got kinda frustrated and I took a brake. maybe 1/2 a month. I realised how much helpful it'd be to work with someone else. So i went to the IRCs and asked for people that would like to help me. that way I found DJRaffa. We worked together created the GitHub repo. We started to work on the GUIs and then - java didn't like us yet again. So we went on the IRCs again and we found hunterb (Theron Boerner). They both were experienced modders, but they didn't actually make anything significant for some time. They watched tutorials and so on and they got back into it. We worked on alot of stuff since then right until now.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis mod is being worked on and maintained by:\r\n* sammko (@sammko)\r\n* DJRaffa (@DJRaffa)\r\n* Theron Boerner (@hunterboerner)\r\n\r\n### License\r\nhttps://github.com/sammko/QuantumCraft/blob/master/LICENSE.txt\r\nGeneral MMPL (Minecraft Mod Public License) with a slight modification.\r\nTechnic pack, Tekkit: We hate you and you are not allowed to distribute this mod in any way or form under any circumstances.
